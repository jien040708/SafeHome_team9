I. Overview
모1. Introduction
모SafeHome is a new product for home automation. Private homeowners or small business can now think of using a Universal device that they can use to access their property with much ease, flexibility and mobility. SafeHome makes this possible by bringing together all the innovative ideas relating to manage the work of a house owner using the latest technology equipments both remotely and locally. Automation has been made feasible by the widely used wireless equipments. 
모The product is quite comprehensible in the current market when more and more people are becoming mobile and ubiquitous. Amongst the most thought about targets, SafeHome focuses on making the home absolutely safe. It provides a convenient way to secure the property for those who require both accessibility and quality of service. 
모To start with, the first version of SafeHome will include only the security and surveillance functions. SafeHome is thought to attract huge number of customers and make a high turnover over a year. Besides fulfilling the basic requirements of security and surveillance, this product will also be standardized to cope with the needs to become Universal device by adding additional functionalities like management, subscription, etc.

모2. Goal
모Providing all the functions for a safe, secure and managed home is the primary goal of this whole project. The customer who uses this product will be ensured that the home is safe.

 Functional goal is to provide the followings:
1)  Security functions
2)  Surveillance functions

 Non-functional goal is as follows:
1)  To fulfill customer satisfaction
2)  To provide highest level of assurance and guarantee
3)  Timely product delivery
4)  To make profit

 In order to make SafeHome features standardized and concurrent with user's requirements we will also have to consider the followings: 
1)  Completeness - The SafeHome system we develop has all the function specified in the function requirements below.
2)  Reliability - The SafeHome system we develops provide reliable services for all the function even in an emergency or an unexpected situation.
3)  Simplicity - We follow the basic principle, "Keep It Simple," in the entire process framework: communication, planning, modeling, construction and deployment. So the entire development process is not very complex and the time to process the work is managed within the planned schedule.
4)  Customized service - The SafeHome system should be configured for a specific homeowners' environment considering the house, life pattern, and personal requirements.
5)  User-friendliness - The SafeHome system has user-friendly interface that homeowners can access anywhere, anytime with ease.

3. Major Functionalities
모1) Security Management
모The security functions in SafeHome product allows the homeowner to arm/disarm system through the control panel or through the web browser and enables the homeowner to respond to an unauthorized access monitored by sensors such as window sensors, door sensors and motion sensors. It also provides functions such as creating and managing safety zone, changing the master password, and configuring system settings such as delay time, master password, guest password, phone number.
모To arm/disarm the system the user has to use passwords to authenticate his identity. The home may be set to any of these statuses like away, home, extend travel, overnight travel. The user can arm/disarm specific safety zones too.
모When there is an authorized access monitored by sensors, the system will raise an audible alarm and call for monitoring service to provide information about the location and report the nature of the event that has been detected. It also will display alarm message on the control panel as well as on the web application of SafeHome product. The user can use panic buttons any time on the control panel to call monitoring service in emergency situations. 

모2) Surveillance Management
모The surveillance function in SafeHome product facilitates the homeowner to observe the house locally and/or remotely. The user can view cameras by selecting from a thumbnail or floor plan, zoom or pan cameras, enable/disable them, and restrict access to specific cameras. 


모4. Plan for Project
모The project will proceed following the concept of incremental software development model. The security functions, surveillance functions and the web access functions which are the core of the SafeHome product will be developed in the first increment. Other functions such as home management functions - controlling the wireless electronic devices - will be developed in the later increments.

III. Assumptions

1. camera monitoring zone in page 164 is defined as camera pan/zoom control
2. Floor plan configuration and hardware deployment is complete and out of the scope of our project.
3. Reconfiguring floor plan or relocating the sensors or cameras are not in the scope of our project.
4. "set alarm" on page 223 is setting delay time defined in the use case "configure system setting"
5. "configure SafeHome system parameters" on page 223 is defined as "configure system setting"
6. "encounters an error condition" on page 195 is not defined as an use case but is described in exceptions of each use cases
7. reconfigure sensors on page 195 is considered as setting floor plan which is not in the scope of our project.
8. "system administrator" in our use case scenarios is not a person who is in charge of managing the system. It is the system itself acting as a facilitator for the use of system functionalities.
9. Doggie angst sensor on page 332 is considered to be implemented in the next increment 
10. Enable/test/read/disable sensors on page 448 is for test cases. We only control sensors through changing house safety situation or by arming/disarming safety zones.
11. We do not consider web pages selling product on page 519
12. We added function to view intrusion log on the web page
13. We added enabling and disabling all the cameras

모모모Use Case:		Enable camera
모모모Primary actor:		Homeowner
모Goal In Context:	Let the homeowner to be able to enable specific camera
Preconditions:	System should be ready, and internet should be set; appropriate user ID and passwords must be obtained.
Trigger:		Homeowner wants to enable one of surveillance camera.
모모모Scenario:
1. The homeowner logs onto the system - see use case : "Log onto the system through web browser"
2. The homeowner selects "surveillance" from the major function buttons.
3. The homeowner selects "pick a camera"
4. The system displays the floor plan of the house.
5. The homeowner selects a camera icon from the floor plan
6. The system asks a password if the selected camera has a password.
7. The homeowner enters the password.
8. The system validates the password. 
9. The system displays the state of the selected camera.
10. The homeowner selects the "enable" button.
11. The system enables the camera.
12. The system activates "disable" button, deactivates "enable" button.
모Exceptions: 
 10a. Camera is already enabled - "enable" button is already deactivated.
1-12. An alarm condition is encountered - see use case: "alarm condition encountered."
모모모Priority:		Essential, must be implemented.
모모모When available:	First increment
모모모Frequency of use:	Many times per day
모모모Channel to actor:	PC-based system with web browser
모모모Secondary actor:	Support technician, Webmaster, Camera.
모모모Channels to secondary actors: 
1. Support technician: phone line.
2. Webmaster: E-mail.
3. Camera: wireless connectivity.
모모모Open issues: 
1. What if the homeowner forgets the specific password for the camera?
2. What if the camera is broken?
3. What if the connection to camera is interrupted by something?
모모모Reference in SEPA: Our assumption
